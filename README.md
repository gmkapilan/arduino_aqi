# arduino_aqi
This python code is used to read PM2.5 sensor data from PMS5003 sensor and display it on LCD along with detecting if the quality is Good or Unhealthy

pm25_aqi_v1 is the simpler working version used to just read, compute and display the AQI values on LCD display
pm25_aqi - this is a work in progress file obtained from a different user this needs to be updated to store the data in flash 
pm25_aqi_ini - Initial version using differnt methods - probably obsolete
